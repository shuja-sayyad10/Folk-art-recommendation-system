The Lord hurried to Bidur’s abode.
Raja Duryadhana covered his mouth with a cloth and sniggered 
“Bidur, are you home? O Bidur are you home?
“For three days I have fasted at your abode.” 
Bidur had (layers of) sewn cloth in his home
Which he offered promptly as a seat (for Krishna).
Bidur and the Vaishnavi are absorbed in the adoration of Hari. 
Offering a banana to the Brahmana, they discarded the peel on the floor.
Bidur exclaims, “O mother, If I am reborn as a human
I shall sing praises of Krishna with all my heart.”
