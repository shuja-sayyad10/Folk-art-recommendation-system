Krishna was exchanged at the house of Nanda (for a newborn baby girl). 
(On being hugged by Devaki) the girl began to cry. 
Hearing the cry, Kamsa’s messenger, who knows where he was hiding, instantly appeared at the doorway.
Snatching the child, he hurled her upon a stone.
But slipping from his grasp, young Durga flew up to heaven. 
From the heavenly Himalayas, she spoke. 
“What will you achieve, O hero, by killing me? 
“The one who shall kill you will be Gokul-born.”
Hearing the heavenly prophesy (he) started speaking (crying).

The foolish milkman’s daughter, realizing nothing
Placed (the little) Sri Hari on the demoness’ lap. 
The (baby) Narayana gurgled delightedly 
And started suckling (at her breast), drinking the demoness’ milk.
