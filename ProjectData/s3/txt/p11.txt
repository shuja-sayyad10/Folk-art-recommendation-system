(When) the two-faced Sakat arrived to carry him away to Mathura.
With an umbrella upon his shoulders, a stick in his hand, he crossed (the river) with his cattle.
And carried Kamala, the calf, across so that she would not drown.
In bounteous palm and honey forests, Krishna rejoiced (with his friends).
While his cattle grazed, Krishna played in the forest.
