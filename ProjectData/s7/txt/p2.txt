Upon hearing such abuse, Bishahari (the vanquisher of poison)
Devoured the six sons of Chand in a fit of rage 
Having devoured the six sons, six brides were widowed. 
Never in his life has the old man (Chand) offered even a handful of flowers (in worship of Manasa).
While others sing songs in her praise in honey-sweet voices
His worship is a constant battle with the One-eyed Wretch (chyang muri kani)
“I still have my youngest son, my precious Lakkhindar.”
