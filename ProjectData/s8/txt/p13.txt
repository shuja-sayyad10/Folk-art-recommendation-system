When Malini claimed to have no more than one sheep, the king was informed by his soldiers that Malini did indeed have many sheep which she herded during the day, but at night they all turned into humans.  She was summoned by the king and confronted. Malini then admitted that she would use her magic to transform these men into sheep.
