Ram released hundreds of arrows at a time.
Volleys of arrows from both warriors tore across the sky. 
Both shot their arrows with all the prowess at their command
Seeing his own (charmed) arrows aimed at himself, Ravana was terrified.
Ram, confident of Ravana’s destruction
Chanted a sacred mantra and released the (divine) arrows 
Two of which pierced Ravana’s heart.
Ravana fell to the ground, writhing in pain
