(Standing) under a tree, Krishna, played his flute.
Upon hearing the melody, the gopis of Braja can barely keep still.
Some dance, some sing, while the rest chant (the name of) Hari 
With Radhaâ€™s name on their lips, the sakhis roll on the ground in ecstasy.
The lord (Krishna) has dressed his turban with a peacock feather.
Garlands from the different flowers of Braja adorn his head.
And atop the variety of Braja garlands, a Bakul flower too is placed.
Golden anklets tinkle on his feet.
