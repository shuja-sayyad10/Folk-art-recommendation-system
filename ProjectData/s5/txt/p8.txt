Krishna is filled with remorse.
He commands his flute to turn into a black snake. 
The flute-turned-snake lies in wait on the road.
Curling around her right ankle, it bites Radha’s left ankle.
Radha (in desperation) agrees to whatever Krishna had asked for. 
“The snake has bitten me, save me please,” she cries.
“Tell me truthfully, aunt,“ (says Krishna) “how far has the poison spread?”
“It has spread to every part of my body,” she cries. 
Krishna then, using his divine touch, drives away the poison from her body. 
Rid of the poison, Radha opens her eyes.
