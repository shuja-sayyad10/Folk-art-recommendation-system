Each scroll (designated s**, where ** refers to the scroll number) has two folders
a. img and 
b. txt.
As the name implies, the img folder contains panel-wise images of the scroll; the txt folder contains the corresponding textual description of the song. In all cases, the images correspond exactly with the textual description -- For e.g., image s1.jpg has a textual description p1.txt associated with it.
