The king Shalbahon was seated on a jewelled throne. 
Srimonto stood before him with folded hands
And said, “In your kingdom, O king, resides Kamal Kamini. 
“I witnessed this woman swallowing an elephant.”
The king ordered Srimonto to show him this sight.
And promised him half of his kingdom and his daughter’s hand in marriage in return. 
But if Srimonto failed to show him the scene, the king warned 
He would be beheaded at the execution ground in the south. 

The king travelled to Kalidaho to see Kamal Kamini.
But to Srimonto’s embarrassment, the vision did not appear. 
The goddess Bhagoboti stayed hidden among the lotuses.
