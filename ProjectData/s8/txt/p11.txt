Meanwhile, Rahuti returned to find Madan missing. It was getting dark so she came up with the idea of seeking work at the king’s court.   

Rahuti, disguised as a man, requested the king for a job. The king replied that there were no jobs left. However, there was an extremely difficult assignment that she could take on: a rhinoceros that was destroying crops in the village needed to be taken down. Would she be able to handle it?  

Rahuti agreed to take on the job and asked to be directed to the location where the rhinoceros had caused damage.  

At the site, she found that the trunk of a palm tree had become very smooth. The reason, she was told, was that the rhinoceros would rub his body daily against this trunk and then proceed to destroy the crops.  

Rahuti asked a woodcutter to cleave the tree half-way through its trunk, and then went and hid, awaiting the rhino. When the rhinoceros arrived and rubbed itself against the trunk, she watched as the tree came crashing down on it, killing it. As a token of proof, Rahuti cut off the dead animal’s tongue.
