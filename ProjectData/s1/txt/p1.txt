Hail Durga, Ma Tara, destroyer of sorrows.
Invincible as the strong southern winds, she is Nagendranandini (daughter of the king of mountains).
As Ma Chandi, her ten arms stretch in ten directions.
Her third eye shines brightly in the middle of her forehead.
Lakshmi, with Saraswati on her left, Kartik and Ganesh
Along with the lion, the Asura, Joya and Bijoya accompany the Mother.
