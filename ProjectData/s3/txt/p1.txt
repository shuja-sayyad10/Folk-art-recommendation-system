(Standing) under a tree, Krishna played his flute.
Upon hearing the melody, the gopis of Braja can barely stay still. 
Some dance, some sing, while the rest chant (the name of) Hari.
With Radhaâ€™s name on their lips, the sakhis roll on the ground in ecstasy.
The lord (Krishna) has dressed his turban with a peacock feather. 
Garlands from the different flowers of Braja adorn his head 
And to the tinkling of cymbals and wooden clappers, a Bakul flower is added atop his head.
On his feet, the Lord has tied anklets.
