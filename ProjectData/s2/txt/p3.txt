“You are my only son, the light of my life,” (cried Khullona) 
“If you leave for even a moment, I shall feel abandoned. “
But, if you must go, do pray to Durga.”
On being invoked, Chandi (Durga) appeared
And Khullona handed over Srimonto to the goddess. 
Shouting “Hail Durga,” Srimonto boarded the boat
And the boatmen set sail.
They were sailing peacefully over the waters
When at Magora, struck by misfortune, they were caught in a terrible storm. 
(And Srimonto witnessed a strange sight:) A beautiful lady seated on a lotus was swallowing an elephant. 
She was Kamal Kamini (a form of Durga) atop a hundred petalled lotus.
She was the mother of Ganesh, swallowing an elephant.
Srimonto, moved by this wondrous sight
Bowed and offered his salutations a million times.

Finally, the boat docked at Ratnamala quay to the sound of kettledrums.
Seeing them, the guards and wardens of the kingdom whispered among themselves.
It seemed as if everyone was looting the kingdom 
And the king was kept totally in the dark.
