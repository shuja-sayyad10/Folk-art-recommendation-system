Seeing Angad, Ravana resorted to illusion:
The court suddenly filled with hundreds of Ravanas.
It was only Indrajit (Ravana’s son) who stood as himself
For it would be shameful for a son to assume his father’s guise.
Seating himself on his coiled tail, Angad faced the assembly
And addressed Indrajit.
“All these Ravanas everywhere, are they all your father?
“Then, bravo, Queen Mandodari! I marvel at your (Indrajit’s) mother
“For, how can one young woman deal with a hundred husbands?
“Who among these is the father who shared a maid- servant’s meal in the netherworld?
“Who among these was bound by my father and still bears the mark of a tail around his neck?
“I have recounted, one by one, the misdeeds of all these ‘fathers’
“But I have no need of them, point out to me your true ‘yogi’ father
“Who disguised as an ascetic, stole Sita.
“And we shall see how you retain your golden Lanka, (Ravana)!”
As the tirade progressed, the atmosphere grew tense.
