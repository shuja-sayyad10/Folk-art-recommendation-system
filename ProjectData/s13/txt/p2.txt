In the Panchabati forest, Rama established a home.
Rama and Sita were seated (in their hut) while Lakshmana stood guard. 
One day Surpanakha arrived at the Panchabati forest
And Lakshmana chopped off her nose and ears.
With her nose in her hand, the widow rushed to the city of Lanka 
And fell at her elder brother Ravanaâ€™s feet.
