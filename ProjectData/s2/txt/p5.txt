Wishing to upset Srimonto, she did not reveal herself.

The enraged king summoned the warden and had Srimonto chained.
Bound in chains and in pain, Srimonto started weeping. 
And as he wept, he invoked Durga
“Oh Shankari,” he cried, “I shall die, but you seem to be unconcerned 
“That your name, Trailokyotarini will be tarnished.”
Chandi, who in the form of a kite, was flying in the sky (heard his prayer). 
She assumed the garb of an aged Brahmin woman and appeared before Srimonto.

His chains fell away from him
And a tearful Srimonto cried out in relief.
With her eighteen arms Mother (Chandi) stood before him at the execution ground. 
“Whose home have you visited, Ma? Who worshipped you?
“My life has become worthwhile, Mother, having seen your eighteen arms.”
