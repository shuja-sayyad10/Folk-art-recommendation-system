The enraged king summoned the warden and had Srimonto chained.
Bound in chains and in pain, Srimonto started weeping. 
And as he wept, he invoked Durga
“Oh Shankari,” he cried, “I shall die, but you seem to be unconcerned 
“That your name, Trailokyotarini will be tarnished.”
Chandi, who in the form of a kite, was flying in the sky (heard his prayer). 
She assumed the garb of an aged Brahmin woman and appeared before Srimonto.
