Later, some palanquin bearers who were passing by saw the dead rhinoceros. Aware of the king’s promised reward of half his kingdom and the hand of his daughter in marriage, they cut off the animal’s head and produced it triumphantly before the king.  

The king then summoned the young man (Rahuti) who had been given the assignment in the first place. When she claimed that it was she who was the true slayer of the rhinoceros, the king demanded proof.  Rahuti asked the king to examine if the tongue was missing from the rhino’s head. When it was found to be indeed missing, she produced the tongue she had cut off earlier.  

The fraudsters were thrown into prison while Rahuti was offered the promised reward. Rahuti (without revealing her true identity) replied that she would do so after she gave worship to goddess Kali.
