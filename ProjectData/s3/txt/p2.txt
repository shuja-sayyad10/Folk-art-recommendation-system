The Lord hurried to Bidur’s abode. 
Raja Duryadhana covered his mouth with a cloth and sniggered.
“Bidur, are you home? O Bidur are you home? 
“For three days I have fasted at your abode.
Bidur, the Vaishnav was so absorbed in the adoration of Hari 
That he put a banana peel into Krishna’s mouth, discarding the banana.
“If I am born a human in my next life 
I shall sing praises of Krishna with all my heart.”
