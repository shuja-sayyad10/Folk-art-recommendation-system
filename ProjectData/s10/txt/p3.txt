The monkeys rushed hither and thither, gathering boulders
Helping the brothers Neel and Nal erect a bridge across the ocean. 
With trees and boulders, the brave brothers built the bridge.
Angad (then) declared that they were ready for battle. 
Gathering all the fragrant flowers from the forest
The monkeys wove them into a garland for Angad.

Shuk and Sharon were told at the sea-shore (by Ravana) 
“The monkeys emit a mighty roar.
“But that is just the sound of wild animals, not to be feared.

“There is only one I dread - let him not return to burn our homes. 
“He can reduce Lanka to ashes in the blink of an eye.
“If that wretch were to return, we are doomed.”
While king Ravana pondered grimly over these matters

The monkey warrior Angad arrived (at his kingdom), to speak to him.
Angad was massive - fifty yojanas wide.
 His gigantic tail touched the sky.
(Seeing him), the guards at the gate took flight.
A powerful kick brought the gate down and Angad entered the fort.
