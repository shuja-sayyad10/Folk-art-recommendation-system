When the divine Krishna plays his flute under the shade of a tree 
All the gopis of Braj go into raptures.
Some dance, some sing while some chant “Hari”.
With Radha’s name on their lips, they roll on the ground in ecstasy.
The lord (Krishna) has tied his turban with a peacock feather. 
A garland made from all the flowers of Braj adorns his head.
To the tinkling of cymbals, a Bakul flower is added to the garland. 
On his feet the Lord has worn anklets.
