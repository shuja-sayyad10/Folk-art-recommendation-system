One day, the goddess Durga bestowed her grace
And revealed a cache of precious gems in a pomegranate grove. 
Kalketu found the treasure under the pomegranate tree
(With this) he cleared the forest named Gujarat and established a town.
Two more pots of gems remained.
Which Kalketu filled into jars.
Sealing them carefully, he carried the jars home
Where the beautiful Khullona (Phullora) waited at the doorway of her thatched hut
For twelve years, the ascetic had been languishing in jail. 
Meanwhile, Khullona had given birth to (their son) Srimonto
Srimonto grew up to be a bright young man
And wished to go out in search of his father.
