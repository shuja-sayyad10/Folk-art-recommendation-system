The marriage of Ramachandra took place and all the rituals were completed.   
But to uphold his father’s promise, Rama went to live in the forest. 
Rama led the way, followed by Janaki  
Lakshmana the archer, brought up the rear. 
With the scorching sun above, and the burning sand beneath their feet 
Sita, delicate as a butter-doll, could barely walk. 
Breaking a (leafy) branch from a tree, Lakshmana held it over her head. 
“Walk slowly, under its shade, Lakshmi.”
