“I hereby grant you a boon, Srimonto”, (Durga replied)
“You shall go and marry the daughter of King Shalbahon.”
Thus, Srimonto married the princess Sushila.

After the wedding, Srimonto returned home

Where Khullona was herding goats in the forest of Aruna.
Srimonto (also) rescued his father and brought him home.

And installing the sacred water pot, introduced the custom of Durga Puja (worship).
Garlanded with hibiscus and jasmine
Shankar Bhabani (Durga) seemed to beckon from afar.

And here ends my recitation.
I, the writer, am Bahar Chitrakar of Medinipur. 
Ah, Medinipur is where I live.
