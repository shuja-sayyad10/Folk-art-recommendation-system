(While) the Sun and the Moon rose at the abode of Kamsa
To Daivaki’s womb,the Lord went to be born. 
Mother Daivaki was fast asleep on her bed.
Standing near her head, the Lord caused her to dream. 
O Mother Daivaki, why do you slumber so deep?
Govinda seeks shelter in your womb. 
In her slumber, the queen narrated a story:
“In my womb, my dear, there is no space left.
“To six sons, I had given birth, but Kamsa has slayed them all.
“Stricken with grief, I have been weeping ever since.”
In the form of a white fly, (Govinda) crept into her womb.
The first month passed; the second month too.
Upon the tenth day of the tenth month the news spread.
On the eighth lunar day of Bhadra, Govinda was born.
Daivaki had given birth to Lord Narayana.
