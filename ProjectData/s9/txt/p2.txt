The monkeys rushed hither and thither, gathering boulders
Helping the brothers Neel and Nal erect a bridge across the ocean. 
With trees and boulders, the brave brothers built the bridge.
Angad (then) declared that they were ready for battle. 
Gathering all the fragrant flowers from the forest
The monkeys wove them into a garland for Angad.
