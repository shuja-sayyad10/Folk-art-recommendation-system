Shouting “Hail Durga,” Srimonto boarded the boat
And the boatmen set sail.
They were sailing peacefully over the waters
When at Magora, struck by misfortune, they were caught in a terrible storm. 
(And Srimonto witnessed a strange sight:) A beautiful lady seated on a lotus was swallowing an elephant. 
She was Kamal Kamini (a form of Durga) atop a hundred petalled lotus.
She was the mother of Ganesh, swallowing an elephant.
Srimonto, moved by this wondrous sight
Bowed and offered his salutations a million times.
