Placing a pot under a Champaka tree, (Manasa’s) worship began. 
Since then, Manasa is worshipped in every household.
And with his left hand he (Chand Sadagar) offered flowers to Manasa. 
Since then, Manasa is worshipped in every household. 
This is where I end my poetic offering. 
Medinipur’s Bahar Chitrakar is the name of the author.
O Medinipur is the address.
