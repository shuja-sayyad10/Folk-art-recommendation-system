They arrived at the Panchabati forest 
Where Rama and Lakshmana set up a thatched hut. 
The two brothers set up the hut. 
While Rama and Sita sat and played a game, Lakshmana stood guard. 

Just then, Surpanakha arrived, looking for flowers. 
Lakshmana caught her and cut off her nose. 
Clutching her severed nose in her hand, she tore back to Lanka 
And fell at her brother Ravanaâ€™s feet.
