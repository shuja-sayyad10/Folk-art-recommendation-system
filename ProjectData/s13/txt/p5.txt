The (dying) deer then began to cry out loud 
“Where are you dear Lakshmana? Come to me.
“Save me from this danger!”
When this heart-rending cry reached Sita’s ears 
She summoned Lakshmana and told him
“Come quickly, brother-in-law Lakshmana, have this betel leaf. 
“You must go find your elder brother in the Dandaka forest.”
“My brother has left me here to guard you, Lakshmi (Sita) 
“And you now ask me to go seek him?”
“Oh, I understand your intentions, brother-in-law Lakshmana, only too well! 
“When Ramachandra dies, you wish to become my consort.”
Covering his ears in shame, Lakshmana took Lord Vishnu’s name. 
“You are like my mother, Sumitra and Raghunath, my father!
“First give me your word, O sage’s daughter. 
“I shall draw a line around the hut
“(But) the face you see, should you cross the line
(Will cause) chaos in the three worlds and great misery will be yours.”
Having marked a boundary, Lakshmana departed.
