How beautiful the deer looked as it danced in myriad ways. 
Janaki pleaded with her husband, “O, Raghuvar (Rama)
“Do catch that deer for me - make me happy. 
“It will ease my sorrow, looking at the deer.”
“Come here, dear brother Lakshmana, I cannot bear (her pain). 
“I shall go catch the deer at Sita’s behest.
“Until I return to this hut
Keep a careful watch over Sita, my brother.” 
With a lusty yell, Rama chased the deer.
But the deer, (swift as) a golden bee, flew off. 
Catching up with the deer, Rama killed it.
