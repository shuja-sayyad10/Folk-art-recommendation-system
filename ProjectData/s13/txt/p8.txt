Speaking tenderly, Ramachandra looked at the (dying) bird
And gazed (tearfully) into his precious eyes. 
“Having mortally wounded me, he has taken your wife, Rama 
“Go rescue Sita first, Rama, gem of the Raghus.”

Having heard the news (of Sita’s abduction) from the bird 
Rama lay grief-stricken under a tree.
“We have left our mother behind at home and our father died there. “
As destined by fate, Sita was stolen from the forest.”
Saying this, Ramachandra grieved silently.
Ravana carried off Sita and kept her in the Ashoka grove. 
Habichak, under Chandipur thana is where I live
And singing the Sitaharan pata song for you, I am Jharna Chitrakar.
