Picking up his son still covered in birth fluid 
Basudeva gently kissed his face
He walked and walked and time went by
The waves of the dark Yamuna (Kalindi) soared in a tumult.
The water, earlier knee-high, rose to the height of a bamboo pole.
Lord Krishna slipped (from his father’s arms) and started floating upon a lotus leaf.
“O what has happened! This wretched fate of mine!
“What a catastrophe I have to deal with at this advanced age of mine.” 
(The Lord) heard Basudeva’s wail and took pity.
Keeping two hands with the river (the child) climbed back on to his lap. 
At the house of Nanda, Krishna was exchanged for a (newborn) baby girl.
That baby girl was brought back and placed on Daivaki’s lap.
