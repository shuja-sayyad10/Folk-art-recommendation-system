The shrewd king Dashanana  came up with such a clever plan. 
Consumed with rage at his sister’s plight 
His whole body seemed to be on fire. 
Summoning Maricha, Ravana laid out his plan. 
“Go, Maricha to that Panchabati forest 
“You will find Rama, Lakshmana and Sita there 
“When Rama tries to catch you 
“You will cry out ‘my dear brother’ 
Thus, Ravana carefully tutored Maricha. 
Maricha, the sorcerer then assumed the form of a deer. 
How beautiful the deer looked as it danced in myriad ways.   
Chandramukhi called out to her husband, Raghuvar (Rama) 
And pleaded with him. 
Do catch that deer for me and make me happy. 
Then, the both of us, sitting in this forest 
Could forget our sorrows, watching the deer. 
“Come here, brother Lakshmana, I cannot bear (her pain).   
“I am off to catch the deer at Sita’s behest. 
“Until I return to this hut 
“Keep a careful watch over Sita, my brother.” 
With a lusty yell, Rama gave chase to the deer.  
But the deer, (swift as) a golden bee, flew off. 
Catching up with the deer, Rama killed it. 
The deer shrieked out loud  
“I am dying at the hands of a demon, dear brother!  
“Come and save me from my distress!” 
The cries reached Sita’s ears. 
“Come here, brother-in-law Lakshmana, have a betel leaf. 
“You must go search the Dandaka forest for your elder brother.” 
“My brother has ordered me to guard you Lakshmi (Sita). 
“Why do you ask me to leave?” 
“Oh, I understand, Lakshmana, I understand your intentions only too well  
“When my lord (Prabhu) dies, you wish to become my consort.” 
Covering his ears in shame, Lakshmana took Lord Vishnu’s name.  
“You are like my mother, Sumitra and Raghunath, my father! 
“Promise me, O sage’s daughter  
“(That you will stay within) the line I am drawing around the hut.”
