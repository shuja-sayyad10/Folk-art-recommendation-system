And then began the combat between Ram and Ravana in the city of Lanka. 
Ram released hundreds of arrows at a time.
Volleys of arrows from both warriors tore across the sky. 
Both shot their arrows with all the prowess at their command
Seeing his own (charmed) arrows aimed at himself, Ravana was terrified.
Ram, confident of Ravana’s destruction
Chanted a sacred mantra and released the (divine) arrows 
Two of which pierced Ravana’s heart.
Ravana fell to the ground, writhing in pain
(As) Brahma and all the other gods in the heavens (looked on).
Of Ravana’s one hundred thousand sons and ten million grandsons
Not one remained to continue his lineage.
His fourteen thousand wives wailed around his fallen body
“Who is left to rule the golden kingdom of Lanka now?”
“Oh, my husband,” wept Mandodori, “though you worshipped Shiva
“He deserted you when you were dying!”
Touching each of the ten faces with a torch, Bibhishan lit the pyre.
And plumes of smoke rose from Ravana’s burning pyre. 
From the Ramayan composed by the poet, Pandit Krittibash 
I end my recitation here.
The name of the author is Bahar Chitrakar of Medinipur. 
Ah, Medinipur is the address.
