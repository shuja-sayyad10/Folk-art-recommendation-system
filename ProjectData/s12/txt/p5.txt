And grabbing Sita’s hand, he pulled her on to his chariot. 
Sobbing piteously, Sita’s face was tear-streaked.  
“Come and save me from this plight, O brother-in-law Lakshmana!” 
Up and away the chariot flew 
(Till) Jatayu, Dasharatha’s friend, came into view.  
Thinking it was an enemy chariot, Jatayu swallowed it whole.  
“Take heed, Jatayu, take heed” Ravana warned. 
“For your friend’s daughter-in-law is in the chariot. 
Ashamed, Jatayu disgorged the chariot.  
With the arrow of Brahma, Ravana struck Jatayu. 
With a cry of pain, Jatayu fell to the ground, dying 
While Sita wept bitterly. 
The song of Ramayan was written by Krittibas. 
Here I end my poetic offering. 
My name is Seramuddin 
My address, Medinipur.
