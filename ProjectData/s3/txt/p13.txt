“You are such a handsome boatman, (but) your boat is broken.”
“It’s not a broken boat O sakhi, but a charioteer’s boat. 
“I have carried horses and elephants across, how heavy could you be?
“Sit as you please O sakhi, in front of me or up ahead. 
“Droplets of water may trickle in, don’t giggle with shame.
“I will take an anna each to carry all your companions. 
“But to row Sri Radhika across, I shall take a gold earring.
“To carry all the sakhis across I will take a buri apiece
“But to carry Sri Radhika across, I shall have the bangles on her wrist.”
Lord Narayan preserved Radhika’s honour.

In agony from the poison, the Lord turned blue.
Endangered, as he was, the Lord evoked Garuda. 
Hearing Garuda’s roar, the serpent fled to the netherworld.
