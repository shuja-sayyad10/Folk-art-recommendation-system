Krishna now assumes the form of Krishna Kali.
Ayan Ghosh stands there in deep thought, observing the scene. 
Seeing Radha offering flowers at Kaliâ€™s feet
He orders Jotila and Kutila not to disturb Radha. 
And that is how aunt and nephew are united. 

And here I end my recitation.
I, the writer, am Bahar Chitrakar 
And I live in Medinipur.
Ah, Medinipur is where I live.
