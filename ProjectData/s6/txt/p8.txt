Lord Narayan, preserving Radhika’s honour
Took the form of Krishna-Kali in the Nidhu grove. 
Ayan Ghosh wondered as he beheld
Srimati (Radha) offering flowers at the feet of Kali. 
The story of Krishna Leela ends here.
All chant Krishna’s name with love and joy. 
In Medinipur district’s Habichak I reside. 
Singing the song of Krishna Leela for you, I am Jharna Chitrakar.
