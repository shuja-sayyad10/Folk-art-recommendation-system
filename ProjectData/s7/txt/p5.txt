She sailed avoiding the banks of foxes and dogs.
And many other such banks she went past. 
(Finally) the raft drifted to the quay of Tamluk.
Dhana-Mana—the two boys, were lying on a bed. 
Nitai (Neta), the washerwoman, washed clothes on the river bank of Tamluk.
“The rotting stink spreads about but how can I get rid of it?” (laments Behula).
A white crow has even bitten the head of Lakkhindar.
Two piles of (washed) clothes were put across for drying. 
Behula’s wash was clean and bright. 
Taking the clothes, Behula went to the abode of the gods
And started dancing before Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. 
She pleased the gods with her performance. 
“What boon do you want, Behula, tell me?”
“Resurrect my six brothers-in-law and my husband.” 
“This boon I grant you Behula, I grant you this boon.”
A small white boat she decorated with heartfelt joy 
(And) Behula returned home only when her husband was brought back to life.
