The night of Ram (Navami) ended and unaccompanied by their husbands
All the sakhis walked towards the Yamuna for a bath.
Their clothes were all stolen by Govinda
Who played his transverse flute on the Kadam tree.
“O moon-faced friends, I tell you
“Raise your arms and beg for your clothes.” 
Having seen the sakhis naked
He threw their clothes back to them, one by one.

(Krishna) built a boat and ferried Radhika across the river. 
You are such a handsome boatman, (but) your boat is broken.
“It’s not a broken boat O sakhi, but a charioteer’s boat.
“I have carried horses and elephants across, how heavy could you be?
“Sit as you please O sakhi, in front of me or up ahead.
“You may need to scoop out a little water, don’t giggle with shame.
